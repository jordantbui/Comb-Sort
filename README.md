Midterm Project 1 Code Implementation
-
Implements the Comb Sort sorting algorithm and analyzes its complexity.

Comb Sort Sorting Algorithm
-
Comb sort is an algorithm that improves the bubble sort by 
using gaps to compare the values. The gaps are determined 
based on the size of the array and shrink by a factor of 1.3.
This helps eliminate smaller values at the end of the list.
- Run Times shown in nanoseconds and milliseconds for all array sizes 
- Analysis, Time Complexity, and Memory Complexity all given in comments section.
